# Sales Performance & Regional Insights Dashboards (Excel)
## Overview
This project presents two Excel-based dashboards developed from the same sales dataset for a technology retail store. Together, the dashboards provide both a high-level performance overview and a deeper regional and product-level analysis, supporting business-focused insight and decision-making.
The project demonstrates how Excel can be used to design multiple analytical views from a single dataset, each tailored to different business questions.
